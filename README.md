Steganography: Hiding Text in Image
AICTE Cyber Security Internship Project

Project Overview:-
This project demonstrates image-based steganography using Python, where secret text messages are hidden inside digital images without changing their visible appearance. The technique uses the Least Significant Bit (LSB) method to conceal the information securely within the image pixels.

Objective:-
To develop a simple and efficient system for embedding and extracting secret messages within images using steganography techniques to ensure data confidentiality and secure communication.

Technologies and Tools Used:-
1.Python
2.Jupyter Notebook
3.Python Libraries:
Pillow (Image processing)
NumPy (Optional, for image manipulation)
